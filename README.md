# Agriculture-Crop-Production-Analysis
The dataset provides detailed information on crops, including production, area, and yield over several years. This analysis aims to identify trends, such as dominant crops and yield variations, and understand the relationship between cultivation area and production. Using data visualization and machine learning, we can uncover patterns, predict future trends, and cluster crops based on characteristics. These insights are valuable for informed decision-making and improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.
* Processed the dataset, handling missing values and renaming columns for consistency.
* Identified trends in production, yield, and area for individual crops.
* Determined the crop with the highest total production and yield.
* Analyzed year-wise changes in area and production for specific crops.
* Created line plots for production trends across years for individual crops.
* Used bar charts and heatmaps to compare crop performance and examine correlations.
* Predicted crop yield using area and production data with regression models.
* Clustered crops with similar trends using K-Means clustering.
